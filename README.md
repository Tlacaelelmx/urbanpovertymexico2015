Repository of urban poverty gpkg files for Mexico 2015 in different disaggregations.

In June 2019, the National Council for the Evaluation of Development Policy (CONEVAL) published the measurement of urban poverty for Mexico in 2015. The data includes tools for spatial visualization of data and maps in .pdf.

The format and organization of this information makes it difficult to use it for deeper spatial analysis, so together with Sergio Uriel Ju√°rez Flores, we develop the following .gpkg files nationwide, from the 32 states, and for 59 metropolitan areas.

We hope that these repositories will facilitate and promote the spatial analysis of poverty and related variables.
